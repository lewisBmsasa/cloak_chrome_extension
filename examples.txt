I  will be the valedictorian of my class, Please write me a 4-line presentation based on the following information:
As a student at CMU, I feel honored to be a part of a prestigious institution known globally for its excellence in education, technology and arts. 
The educational journey at Carnegie Mellon University has been nothing less than enlightening. 
The dedicated professors here at Carnegie Mellon always ensure that we get the best educational experience. Moreover, the innovative technology used for teaching at CMU is commendable, paving the way for a more comprehensive learning experience. 
As a 24 year old student at Carnegie, the opportunities are endless. 

I graduated from CMU, and I earn a six-figure salary now. Today in the office, I had some conflict with my boss, and I am thinking about whether I should start interviewing with other companies to get a better offer.
